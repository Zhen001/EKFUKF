I is not diag(0,0,1) but (1,1,1)
Not true that depends only on q/r? P tends to zero, order magnitude depends on q only, numerical precision!
Real case use sigma>1, measurement error!?
More robust with sigma 1e-4, q 1e-3. With q really small, really similar?
q = 1e-7 seems to offer results most similar to paper?
