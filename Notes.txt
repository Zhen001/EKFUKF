I is not diag(0,0,1) but (1,1,1)
Not true that depends only on q/r? P tends to zero, order magnitude depends on q only, numerical precision!
With noise sigma must be >1, measurement error!?
q = 1e-7 seems to offer results most similar to paper?

ekf divides by r -> q small, sigma small -> r very small -> unstable
q=1e-10 -> r=1e-12, H P H' ~ 1e-10 eps=1e-16
ukf sums r -> q big, sigma big -> q very big -> prevails on signal

note how in the visualization the uncertainty is proportional to the derivative of the state!
